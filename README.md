# HyprV4
This is V4 of the Hyprland install script

It contains a collection of dot config files for hyprland with a simple install script.
IMPORTANT - This script was meant to run on a clean fresh Arch install on physical hardware but now i port it to Gentoo, currently only OpenRC as init system is used since its Gentoos Standard and Nividia drivers untested, i will add them back later when finishing getting it to work.

Installing on Gentoo can take time.


Use the attached script "set-hypr" to install everything for you.
