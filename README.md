# HyprV4
This is V4 of the Hyprland install script

Important the configs for hyprland etc. dont work with gentoo so you have to configure manually.
It contains a collection of dot config files for hyprland with a simple install script.
IMPORTANT - This script was meant to run on a clean fresh Arch install on physical hardware but now i port it to Gentoo, currently only OpenRC as init system is used since its Gentoos Standard and Nividia drivers untested, i will add systemd and nvidia option back later when finishing getting it to work normally or you can help with opening a pull request.

Installing on Gentoo can take time.

Waybar will take a lot lot lot of time, you can check the status in the install.log. (Since large packages are needed as dependencies, welcome to Gentoo my Friend)

Use the attached script "set-hypr" to install everything for you.
